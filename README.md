Snap x RCA project exploring senses on AR.
## 1. File Directory
- sense-misalign: Final result of the Snap x RCA project
- models final: Working version in terms of interaction
- ChemTutorPrototype: tutorial by Laura Chambers (AR Engineer at Snap)
## 2. Software
- Applying delta movement
- Applying delta rotation
- Hand tracking
- Grab gesture
- Developed in Lens Studio 4.55
## 3. Starting from the Scratch
- For easier integration, the object should be labeled 'P' in the Snap Lens Studio.
- Find 'Hand Physics' from the asset library and add it under the camera
- Bit different part with Laura Chambers' project is that as the Hand Physics asset is updated, we don't really have to set up the hand tracking mode in 'attachment' and 'Proportions and Pose'. (But it's good to know the mechanics of it - refer to her tutorial)
